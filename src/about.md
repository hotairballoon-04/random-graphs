This project aims to provide insights into random graph theory through interactive visualizations and analyses. Using Python and libraries like NetworkX, Matplotlib, and Streamlit, it generates random graphs based on user-defined parameters, explores their properties, and visualizes key metrics such as degree distribution, connectivity, and more.

## Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): The backbone of the project, facilitating data analysis, graph generation, and visualization.
- [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/): A Python library for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks, forming the core of the graph generation process.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Utilized for creating visualizations of the generated graphs and their properties.
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): Empowering the interactive web interface for exploring random graph properties and visualizations.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/hotairballoon-04/random-graphs): Hosts the codebase for this project.
